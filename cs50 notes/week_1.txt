This week we were introduced to C.
the syntax is just like JavaScript but you need to declare your types (int, string, float, and the like).

We covered the basics of the language.
loops, functions, parameters, variables, datatypes, truncation.

We did Hello World with C and then wrote a program that:
Takes in an  int  as starting_population of llamas.
Takes in an  int  (same size or larger) as end_population.

    and calculated years to reach end population 

    using:
    new_llamas = starting_population / 3;
    dead_llamas = starting_population / 4;

now theres one more challenge or activity to complete.
