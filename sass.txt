sass 
  sass stands for syntactically awesome stylesheets.
  sass requires ruby to be installed because its written in ruby. 
  

//
  sass supports regular multi line comments but also enables you to use single line comments

nesting
  sass lets you nest style rules in similar syntax to html.
     example:
     .listclass {
         ul {
             padding: 3px;
             margin: 10px;
             height: 10vh;
             width: fit-content;
            }

         li {
             background-color: white;
            }

         li:nth-child(odd) {
             background-color: lightgray;
            }

         a {
             color: blue;
             text-decoration: none;
            }
     }

  you can also nest properties with the same prefix in the same way.
     example:
         font: {
             family: Helvetica;
             size: 200px;
             weight: bold;
         }
