bits vs bytes 
bits are 1's and 0's ... this is how computers count. 
almost like how humans have a 1's 10's and 100's place, 
computers just use doubles. they have either a 1 or a 0
for each place the count goes like this:
   128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1

	so to write 56, it would be 
	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
	or for  42, it'd be
	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
	or for  43, it'd be
	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1

a byte is a sequence or unit of 8 bits
