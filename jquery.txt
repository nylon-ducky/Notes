syntax 
 basic jquery syntax goes like this;
     $(selector).action();
         a dollar sign to say youre using jquery.
         a selector inside braces to say what youre wanting to work with.
         and an action to preform

$(document).ready(function(){     });
 all jquery needs to be wrapped inside a document ready function to prevent it from running before the page is created in the browswer. you cant manipulate something that doesnt exist yet!
