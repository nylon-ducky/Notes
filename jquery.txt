syntax 
 basic jquery syntax goes like this;
     $(selector).action();
         a dollar sign to say youre using jquery.
         a selector inside parentheses to say what youre wanting to work with.
         and an action to preform


$(document).ready(function(){     });
 all jquery needs to be wrapped inside a document ready function to prevent it from running before the page is created in the browswer. you cant manipulate something that doesnt exist yet! 
 ((you should still do this even if using the defer attribute on your script tag))
 

you can also add multiple event handlers to one element
$("p").on({
    mouseenter: function(){
        $("this").css("background-color", "blue");
    },
    mouseleave: function(){
        $("this").hide();
    },
    click: function(){
        $("this").show();
    }
});


.hide() .show()
  these methods should not be placed on content directly, but are best used for a dropdown or something. they can take parameters of time either in milliseconds or "fast" and "slow" but the words must be in quotations. they can also take in a second parameter, seperated by a comma, to designate a function to be preformed after the hiding or showing of the element. this is called a callback function.


.fadeIn() .fadeOut() .fadeToggle()
  these can also all take in fast slow or millisecond parameters, and a callback function.this is also the same syntax for slide methods

.fadeTo()
  this method is used to fade into an opacity between 0 and 1. it can take miliseconds or fast/slow, and the opacity value, seperated by a comma.

animate()
  $("#dosomething").animate({bottom: '1vh'}, "slow", callbackfunction);
  the animate method is the same as every other method until you get to the parameters. the last two are the same as all others, you specify a speed (optional), and a callback function. but the first parameter goes inside a set of curly braces (just like normal css) and specifies a property to animate and the value it should transition to. this could also get a little more exciting too! you can animate multiple properties seperated by a comma, like so;
  $("#dosomething").animate({
     width: '95px',
     height: '160px',
     margin: '180px',
     bottom: '44px'
  },"slow");
                to animate properties with multiple words, like background-color must be written  in camelCase rather than with a dash. 

                ALSO color animation is not included in the core jquery library, so youll need to download a plugin for that.

                you may also use show, hide, or toggle as property animation values. toggle will switch between 0 and the pre-defined value.
